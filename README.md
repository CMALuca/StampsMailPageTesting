Stamps Mail Page Testing
====================

A cucumber Boilerplate project that runs Webdriver IO tests on the Stamps.com Mail page. It goes through the various elements on that page and automatically fills in the relevant fields necessary for an international netstamp.

Boilerplate code obtained from: [here](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate)

## Requirements

- Node version 8 or higher
- A preconfigured Selenium Grid, preinstalled browser driver or cloud provider account

This project works fine with both NPM and Yarn, so feel free to choose whichever you prefer.

This project works fine with the included WebDriverIO test runner, but you should probably consider setting up a proper test environment using Selenium or any other test environment that you prefer. This project will not go into detail on how to get an environment set up.
